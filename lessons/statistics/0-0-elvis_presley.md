Bayesâ€™ Theorem is an important tool in understanding what we really know, given evidence of other information we have, in a quantitative way. It helps incorporate conditional probabilities into our conclusions.

Elvis Presley had a twin brother who died at birth. What is the probability that Elvis was an identical twin? Assume we observe the following probabilities in the population: fraternal twin is 1/125 and identical twin is 1/300.
