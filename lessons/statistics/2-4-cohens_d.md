[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

`
Cohen’s D is an example of effect size. Other examples of effect size are: correlation between two variables, mean difference, regression coefficients and standardized test statistics such as: t, Z, F, etc. In this example, you will compute Cohen’s D to quantify (or measure) the difference between two groups of data.
`

`
You will see effect size again and again in results of algorithms that are run in data science. For instance, in the bootcamp, when you run a regression analysis, you will recognize the t-statistic as an example of effect size.
